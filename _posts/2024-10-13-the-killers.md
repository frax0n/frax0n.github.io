For anyone who knows me, they've definitely heard my ringtone – "Mr. Brightside" by The Killers. 
Despite being American,The killers have an undeniable connection with the British audience. Their music resonates deeply with the UK crowd, and "Mr. Brightside" has become iconic, holding the record as the longest-charting single on the UK Official Singles Chart Top 100, with an impressive 408 weeks.

The first name in the crossword tattoo on my right arm, and the band I've been closely following since my college days.
Brandon Flowers has a remarkable way with words, often highlighting deep emotions or problematic themes, yet wrapping them in such a melodic, uplifting sound that it's a joy to listen to.

I currently have five (with sixth on its way) music CDs from them for some reason , despite not really having a device to play actual CDs as they are pretty obsolete nowadays. 

## My favourite albums -
### Hot Fuss -

Ah, the audio CD I've wanted the most! It costs 13 times the price of other albums because it’s the most sought after by collectors item when it comes to The Killers. Hot Fuss, their debut album, marked the beginning of their legacy and opened a window for the public to experience the magic they created. The album has a rather crude production quality, sounding compressed, but that’s part of its charm.
### Some notable songs from this album:

- **Believe Me, Natalie** - A classic somber rock and roll song.
- **Mr. Brightside** - Do I really need to elaborate?
- **On Top** - An upbeat song with great string instrumentation.
- **Jenny Was a Friend of Mine** - A classic heartbreak rock song (we get a remake later with Bruce Springsteen!).
- **Smile Like You Mean It** - Another somber classic.
- **Somebody Told Me** - A fast-paced song fueled by anger with iconic thrashy guitar verses



# WIP!
