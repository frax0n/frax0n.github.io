# About

Hey there! I'm Harsh, your go-to Senior Data Engineer with a knack for turning data chaos into neat, orderly insights. By day, I’m wrangling data and debugging code; by night, I'm either battling dragons in my favorite video games or headbanging to Metal Core tunes, especially with Bring Me the Horizon cranking through my speakers. If you ever need someone to optimize a database or beat the final boss, I’m your guy! Just don’t ask me to choose between my love for data and my obsession with epic guitar riffs—because, honestly, it’s a hard-fought tie!
